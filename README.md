# Milestone2.
## Recipe-CRUD application.
### Made by: Calypso Riebe, Lawrence Graham, and Richard Foil.

This CRUD application is the combined efforts of three ThriveXD bootcamp students. The goal of this project was to create and deploy as working CRUD application.
We chose to make the application a recipe sharing application where you can create new recipes, view exsisting ones and update them, as well as delete older recipes. 
The application is connected to a mongo database which stores all of the application's recipe data. 

The majority of the code is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Thank you and Enjoy.
